# Advent of Code 2023
My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2023. We'll see how far I get this year. Last year I made it to day 14; the prior year to day 10.  

Happy Holidays!

## Notes  
**Day 1**  
I accidentally did Part 2-style parsing first (so got the answer to Part 1 wrong initially). I commented out some code to get the Part 1 answer. So the tests are all around Part 2.  

*Made it to Day 8!* (so far)
